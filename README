Based on mxcl's work here: https://gist.github.com/149491/

This is a ruby script that uses Mac OS X's FSevents API and rsync to sync changes from the local file system to a remote location. It can be invoked like this:

ruby syncer -u eanderson -H myhost.com -p ~/documents/workspace

growlnotify must be installed on your system.
